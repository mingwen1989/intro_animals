        <p>   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
              Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
              Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
              Heroes in a half-shell
              Turtle power!

              They're the world's most fearsome fighting team (We're really hip!)
              They're heroes in a half-shell and they're green (Hey - get a grip!)
              When the evil Shredder attacks
              These Turtle boys don't cut him no slack!

              Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

              Splinter taught them to be ninja teens (He's a radical rat!)
              Leonardo leads, Donatello does machines (That's a fact, Jack!)
              Raphael is cool but crude (Gimme a break!)
              Michaelangelo is a party dude (Party!)

              Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
              Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
              Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
              Heroes in a half shell
              Turtle power! </p>

        <h1>Snakes</h1>
        <p>Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes[2] that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.</p>

        <h1>Insects</h1>

          <p>Insects (from Latin insectum, a calque of Greek ἔντομον [éntomon], "cut into sections") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are among the most diverse groups of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms.[2][3] The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million,[2][4][5] and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth.[6] Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.</p>
